## Inventory files, SSH config and SSH key files

This directory will hold the following types of files.
For each environment, a dedicated folder will be created.

- Inventory files generated by the TripleO Inventory play.
- Ansible.ssh.config file that allow to establish direct connection from the locahost to the overcloud node (controller/compute/etc).
- Overcloud SSH public key.
- In case 'ssh_pass' parameter is used, a new ssh key will be generated for the Undercloud host.
