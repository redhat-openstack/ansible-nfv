Every new line will be placed in one long single line, like here [2].\n\nPlease, change it, as it is very hard to read this bulk of lines.\n\n[1] - https://github.com/redhat-openstack/ansible-nfv/blob/master/roles/tester/tempest/tasks/main.yml#L124-L164\n[2] - https://github.com/redhat-openstack/ansible-nfv/blob/master/roles/post_install/openstack_tasks/tasks/instances.yml#L42-L50",
