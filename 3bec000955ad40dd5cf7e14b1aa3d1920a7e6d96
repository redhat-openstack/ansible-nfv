If there are timeouts and failures is because there is a problem we need to debug",

      "message": "The point is to not get it stuck in a pending state with a timeout as we saw, generally, it just writes the output to a file and then reads it to check if it failed/worked/timed out. The reason I\u0027m checking for timeout is to allow the detection of stuck binary search which we encountered last week with the HW offload job. We do not avoid timeout and failure we just re-try 3 times if we encounter any timeout or failure (which is similar to what we did before) then you have the log to read from if you want to debug.",
