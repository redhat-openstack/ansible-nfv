      "message": "Hey @yogananth\n\nI think if you\u0027d like to add it, you should also try to provide a solution to the Trex cfg file with the necessary changes.\nOtherwise, whoever going to execute it with the \"mac\" mode, will probably encounter a broken perf flow.\n\nIn our current setup, Trex cfg file is tied to work with the binary search script flow: TRex port 0 \u003e Trex port 1, and Trex port 1 \u003e Trex port 0.\n\nWhere in the proposed change above, you should also alight Trex server to support it: Trex port 0 \u003e DUT port 1, and Trex port 1 \u003e DUT port 0.\n\nThanks.",
