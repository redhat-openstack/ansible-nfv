***
Notes:
VlanIds and Ports should be syncronized with the
config of the nic port and vlan id on the Moongen side.
For example VLAN 396 should be allowed on the nic port 0.
The traffic from the nic port 0 on the Moongen will be
passed to the nic port 1 on the guest, and passed back
from the nic port 0 on the guest to the nic port 1
on the Moongen.

***
The variables could be applied to the playbook run, by saving them into a separate yml file and include the file during the playbook execution.  
Note the '@' sign, which is used to apply the variables located within the provided file.
