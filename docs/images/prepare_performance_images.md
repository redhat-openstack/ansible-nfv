# Guest Image Customization For Perfomance Usecases

## Description
The prepare_performance_images play performs the following tasks:
- Prepares repos for RHEL/CentOS 7 images
- Clones Trex from upstream repo to guest image
- Clones DPDK from upstream repo and compiles it

**Note!** - virt_customize moduless are planned to be shipped in this repo until they're available in PyPI
**Note!** - Inventory file is required if attempting to run on default undercloud node
**Note!** - DPDK is being compiled without:
* [rt-kni](https://doc.dpdk.org/guides/prog_guide/kernel_nic_interface.html) - This feature allows DPDK to leverage it's user space capabilites for NICs bound to kernel, disabling it due to:
    * Requiring kernel modules during compilation, which will require additional logic for virt-customize
    * Not relevent to NFV-QE usecases
* [UIO](https://doc.dpdk.org/guides/linux_gsg/linux_drivers.html#uio) - Basic kernel module which configures the device, maps device mermory to user space and handles interrupts, disabling it due to:
    * Requiring kernel modules during compilation, which will require additional logic for virt-customize
    * Not relevent to NFV-QE usecases, we use vfio instead

* Repos
    * Uses CentOS public repos to customize RHEL/CentOS images
* Prepare Trex
    * Clones Trex binaries from repo
* Prepare DPDK
    * Clones DPDK binaries from repo
    * Compiles DPDK binaries

## Run triggers
* prepare_repo - Executed if 'true'. True by default.
* prepare_trex - Executed if 'true'. True by default.
* prepare_dpdk - Executed if 'true'. True by default.

## Examples
The examples of running the playbook:

Retrieve CentOS image, prepare CentOS repo, install default DPDK and Trex binaries:
```
ansible-playbook playbooks/images/prepare_performance_images.yml
```

Specify custom repo file for image
```
ansible-playbook playbooks/images/prepare_performance_images.yml -e @/path/to/repo_vars.yaml
```

Don't prepare repos for guest image
```
ansible-playbook playbooks/images/prepare_performance_images.yml -e prepare_repo=False
```

Specify different RHEL/CentOS/Fedora image to be customized:
```
ansible-playbook playbooks/images/prepare_performance_images.yml -e guest_image="http://url-to-image.com"
```

Opt out of DPDK/Trex customization:
```
ansible-playbook playbooks/images/prepare_performance_images.yml -e prepare_dpdk/trex=False
```
