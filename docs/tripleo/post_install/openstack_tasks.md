# Openstack tasks

## Description
Openstack tasks play perform the following tasks on the existing Openstack environment.

* Setup Openstack environment
    * Creates and prepares the virtual pip environment with all required command line tools.  
      Creates clouds.yml file with all the details for the connection to the Openstack env.
* Creates networks
    * Creates networks, subnets and routers by using the variables list provided to the play.  
      Public networks sets as a gateway on the router and private networks sets as a router interface by using the 'external' flag within the variables provided.
* Upload images
    * Upload provided images to the glance store of the overcloud.
* Creates flavors and extra_specs
    * Creates flavors for the instances. Extra_specs could be created for the flavors if required.
* Creates keypair
    * Creates keypair and fetch the file to the client.
* Creates security groups
    * Creates security groups with defined protocols.
* Boot an instance(s)
    * Boot the defined instances on the overcloud.
* Overcloud delete
    * Deletes the required stack.  
      Default stack is - 'overcloud'.

By default, all the tasks runs one by one on the environment.  
The run could be separated by specifying tags of specific run.

## Role tags
* setup_os_env - Run Openstack virtual env creation for env tasks.
* network - Run networks creation.
* flavor - Run flavors creation.
* image - Upload images to the Openstack environment.
* keypair - Run keypair creation.
* security_group - Run security groups creation.
* instance - Boot defined instances.
* overcloud_delete - Delete the required overcloud stack.

## Run triggers
* setup_os_env - Executed if 'true'. True by default.
* network - Executed if 'true'. True by default.
* flavor - Executed if 'true'. True by default.
* image - Executed if 'true'. True by default.
* keypair - Executed if 'true'. True by default.
* security_group - Executed if 'true'. True by default.
* instance - Executed if 'true'. False by default.
* overcloud_delete - Executed if 'true'. False by default.
