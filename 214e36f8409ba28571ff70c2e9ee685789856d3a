If not, the param is not important.\n\nThe param should exist within the defaults with some simple explanation because the user should not read all the tasks, but get all the variables from the documentation.\n\nI suggest setting compute_min_microversion to \u0027\u0027.\nAnd here you check it like:\n{% if compute_min_microversion !\u003d \u0027\u0027 %}\napply it\n{% endif %}",
