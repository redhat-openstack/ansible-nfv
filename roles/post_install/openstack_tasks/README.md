# Openstack tasks

## Description
The `openstack tasks` role performs the following tasks on the existing Openstack environment.

* Setup Openstack environment
    * Creates and prepares the virtual pip environment with all required command line tools.  
      Creates clouds.yml file with all the details for the connection to the Openstack env.
* Creates users, projects, clouds.yaml user configs.
    * Creates users and projects based on the specified variables.
    * Generates users rc files.
    * Generates users configs within the clouds.yaml file for the later tasks by the users.
* Creates quota
    * Creates quota for a project such as number of cpu's cores, ram, instances.
* Creates networks
    * Creates networks, subnets, routers and ports by using the variables list provided to the play.  
      Public networks sets as a gateway on the router and private networks sets as a router interface by using the 'external' flag within the variables provided.  
      The interfaces for the instance could be specified as a network name or as a created port name.
      In case networks should be created under specific tenant add cloud_name for resource.
      Please refer config_example.yml 
* Upload images and set image properties
    * Upload provided images to glance stores. Properties can set if required.
* Aggregate groups
    * Creates aggregation groups with defined hosts and metadata.  
      **NOTE** - a must configuration is required: enable "AggregateInstanceExtraSpecsFilter"  
      in a /etc/nova/nova.conf file (controllers nodes) to the scheduler_default_filters defenition.
* Creates flavors and extra_specs
    * Creates flavors for the instances. Extra_specs could be created for the flavors if required.
* Creates keypair
    * Creates keypair and fetch the file to the client.
      In case keypair should be created under specific tenant add cloud_name for resource.
      Please refer config_example.yml 
* Creates security groups
    * Creates security groups with defined protocols.
      In case security group should be created under specific tenent add cloud_name for resource.
      Please refer config_example.yml 
* Boot an instance(s)
    * Boot the defined instances on the overcloud.
      In case instance should be created under specific tenent add cloud_name for resource.
      Please refer config_example.yml 
* Overcloud delete
    * Deletes the required stack.  
      Default stack is - 'overcloud'.
* Resources output file generation
    * Generates yaml resources file with instances and keypair details.

By default, all the tasks runs one by one on the environment.  
The run could be separated by specifying tags of specific run.

## Role tags
* setup_os_env - Run Openstack virtual env creation for env tasks.
* user - Run users and projects creation and.
* quota - Run quota creation.
* network - Run networks creation.
* net_port - Run instance port creation.
* aggregate - Run group aggregate creation.
* flavor - Run flavors creation.
* image - Upload images to the Openstack environment.
* keypair - Run keypair creation.
* security_group - Run security groups creation.
* instance - Boot defined instances.
* overcloud_delete - Delete the required overcloud stack.
* resources_output - Generate instance and keypair details yaml file.

## Run triggers
* setup_os_env - Executed if 'true'. True by default.
* user - Executed if 'true'. False by default.
* quota - Executed if 'true'. False by default.
* network - Executed if 'true'. True by default.
* net_port - Executed if 'true'. True be default.

**NOTE:** Currently os_floating_ip module doesn't return FIP in a consistent matter when an instance contains multiple NICs
* resource_generate_inventory - Add generated instances to dynamic Ansible inventory

## Role default variables
#### State of the resource
The state could be 'present' or 'absent'.
```
resource_state: present
```

#### The name of the "cloud", the tasks should be run on.
The "cloud" represents a stack (undercloud/overcloud), or a user that the playbook should interact with.  
All "clouds" configuration resides within the "~/.config/openstack/clouds.yaml" file.  
A different cloud name could be set on each resource.  
As a result multiple users resources could be created at a single playbook run.
```
cloud_name: overcloud
```

#### The path to the clouds.yaml file.
```
clouds_yaml_file_path: ~/.config/openstack/clouds.yaml
```

#### List of users and projects that should be created
#### Quotas could be defined for a user if needed.
```

#### Overcloud delete variables
Rc file path for the access to the stack.

Default is - **overcloud**
```
overcloud_name: overcloud
```

The file location of client pem file on remote host  
Default is - None
```
client_ca_cert: /path/to/the/file
```

The path to the file output of the created resources.
Will contain booted instances and keypair details.  
Example of usage: Could be used by the tempest in order to execute the tests  
on already provisioned resources.
```
resources_output_file: /home/stack/resources_output_file.yml
```

Generate a dynamic Ansible inventory based on resources created.  
**NOTE:** As of now, it's broken due to `os_floating_ip` module not being consistent when an instance contains multiple NICs. Please refer to [Dynamic Host Inventory Role](../tripleo_inventory/README.md) for a workaround.
Default is - **False**
```
resource_generate_inventory: False
```

***
The variables could be applied to the playbook run, by saving them into a separate yml file and include the file during the playbook execution.  
Note the '@' sign, which is used to apply the variables located within the provided file.
