# Multiqueue/autobalance injection

## Description
Role used to inject to a specific number of queues or to learn about different queues

It will execute multiqueue.py script which has the following options:
usage: multiqueue.py [-h] --action
                     {learning,parse_testpmd,parse_pmd_stats,gen_traffic}
                     [--packets [PACKETS [PACKETS ...]]]
                     [--traffic_json TRAFFIC_JSON] [--log LOG]
                     [--pmd_stats_file PMD_STATS_FILE] [--duration DURATION]
                     [--multiplier MULTIPLIER] [--pps PPS]

It has 3 main functions:
* learning: Using scapy it generates several packets with different source or
  destination ip address. Each packet will have different size too so that it
  can be recognized either by the ip or the packet size. In testpmd it is
  possible to log each packet received in each queue, but it is not printed
  out the ip, so using a map between ip and packet size it is possible to know
  which ip is being received in that queue

* parse_testpmd: parse testpmd log. It gets which queue received each packet

* parse_pmd_stats: parse pmd log. It maps queue ids from pmd stats command to
  the queue ids got from testpmd.log
  In order to map queues ids, the following is required:
  1. queue ids "0" will have the higher rate for both ports
  2. queue id "0" will be higher in port 0 than in port 1
  3. rate for the following ports will decrease
  Example:
  port 0:
     queue 0, rate 1.2
     queue 1, rate 0.5
     queue 2, rate 0.1
  port 1:
     queue 0, rate 0.8
     queue 1, rate 0.5
     queue 2, rate 0.1

* gen_traffic: generate traffic using trex, it is possible to send traffic to
  specific queues

Examples on how to use it:
* learning:
  multiqueue.py  --action learning --packets 0 40
  It will generate packets from 48.0.0.1 to 48.0.0.40. It will generate traffic
  in both interfaces, in one interface this will be source ip while in te other
  it will be destination ip

* parse_testpmd:
  multiqueue.py --action parse_testpmd --packets 0 40 --log /tmp/testpmd.log
                --traffic_json /tmp/queues.json
  It will parse testpmd log and generate queues.json file with a list of ip
  address received by each port and queue.

* parse_stats_file:
  multiqueue.py  --action parse_pmd_stats --traffic_json /tmp/queues.json
                 --pmd_stats_file /tmp/output
                 --pps "[{'0': 1.2, '1': 0.5,'2':0.1},{'0':0.8,'1': 0.5,'2':0.1} ]"
  Parses file generated with command "ovs-appctl dpif-netdev/pmd-rxq-show" after
  injecting traffic

* gen_traffic:
  multiqueue.py --traffic_json /tmp/queues.json --duration 60 --multiplier 1 \
                --pps "[{{"0": 0.5}},{{"1": 0.8}}]"
  Using trex it will inject traffic to the specific queues. In this case, it
  will inject 0.5 mpps to port 0 queue 0 and 0.8 mpps to port 1 queue 1.
  Ports, queues and flows to used are defined in queues.json file. Injection
  duration will be 60 seconds. With multiplier parameter it can inject at
  higher rates, for example, if multiplier would have been 10, injections
  would be at 5 and 8 mpps.

## Variables

Multiqueue packet generator absolute path

```
mq_bin: "{{ trafficgen_dir }}/{{ mq_file }}"
```

Packet generator will start using ips from base_ip + min_packet_index

```
min_packet_index: 0
```

Packet generator will start using ips until base_ip + min_packet_index + max_packet_index

```
max_packet_index: 40
```

testpmd log file

```
testpmd_log: "/tmp/testpmd.log"
```

File generated with the mapping of queues and ips

```
queues_json: "/tmp/queues.json"
```

Mode used in multiqueue traffic generator: available: parse, parse_testpmd, parse_pmd_stats, gen_traffic

```
action: "learning"
```

Duration of injection when using gen_traffic mode

```
duration: 180
```

Increase traffic rate when using gen_traffic mode
