      "message": "I will raise a suggestion and let you decide to apply it or continue with the existing flow.\n\nYou are looping trough the ipmi hosts by accepting them via the extra variables.\nIn the previous version of switch configuration role, I did the same flow, but later changed it to work with the inventory file.\n\nThe reason for the change, and my suggestion to work with the inventory is the following.\n* Our ipmi hosts are permanent. They do not change recently and update of the inventory will not be required.\n* When using inventory, the flow of the playbook will be performed in a single run and execute on the hosts in parallel. When you are looping through the hosts it will take much more time to update the hosts because the update will be performed one by one.",

      "message": "Hey Maxim.\n\nThis is a great suggestion I\u0027m just unsure on how to build this flow correctly.\nWhere should I store our private IPMI hosts, I don\u0027t want to expose it in this repo.\nAlso, how should I approach on managing an inventory for IPMI hosts when I want to run everything from local, can I just do a general delegate_host on the hosts level?",

      "message": "The storing of the ipmi hosts inventory could be in the nfv-qe repo as we are doing with the switches inventory.\n\nCurrently, we have a branch called \"switches_config\".\nWe could do two options:\n1) Rename the \"switches_config\" branch to let\u0027s say \"global_config\" to store all nfv qe related configurations.\n2) Create a separate branch to store ipmi related config.\n\nI\u0027m voting for the first option. But it is up to your decision.\n\n\nYou can just execute the playbook directly on the ipmi hosts. As every usual playbook. No need to delegate_to.",
