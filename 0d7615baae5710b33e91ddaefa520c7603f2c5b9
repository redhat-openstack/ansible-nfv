Here is the issue:\n\nERROR: molecule 3.0.4 has requirement ansible\u003e\u003d2.8, but you\u0027ll have ansible 2.7.17 which is incompatible.\nERROR: molecule-vagrant 0.2 has requirement ansible\u003e\u003d2.9.5, but you\u0027ll have ansible 2.7.17 which is incompatible.\n\nmolecule requires a higher version. I didn\u0027t want to change the existing requiremebts file, I will clean up the file to remove unnecessary entries and keep ansible requirements. Once we support ansible 2.9 in general, asnible can be removed from this requirement file.",
